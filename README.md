# cs-ilp-core
This is a C# implementation of Interledger Protocol v4.  
Refer to [ILPv4 RFC](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/387).

## Objectives
- To understand ILP deeply
- To show ILP structure by code which is easy to understand
- To publish this library finally

So, we don't put priority on efficiency, whether the code runs fast or not, and extensibility.
Just aim to make it simple and easy to understand.

## Environment
- VisualStudio
- .NET Standard 2.0
